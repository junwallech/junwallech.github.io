<h2>Only Me... A Resume</h2> 
		 <p 1>I was born in Hunan, China in November of 2002. I was adopted from an orphanage when I was 16 months old, and was brought to America with my Japanese mother and American father. and I have lived in America for 12 years. I have grown up learning Japanese and English fluently, and attend two schools. For the first seven and a half years of education, I have attended Asahi Gakuen Orange County District, but have recently moved to a Japanese School in Long Beach and am at the High School and Adult Level 4 class. Despite the homework, I have gotten a rich education attending Mark Twain Elementary School, Hubert H. Bancroft Middle School, and hopefully Woodrow Wilson Classical High School to continue this journey.</p>
	<p 2>I am an only child, and have my own room, but unfortunately, I get really lonely sometimes, and the only way to entertain myself without annoying my parents is either daydreaming, reading, or writing. Starting in second grade is when my father really got me into reading, starting with the classical books such as Bram Stoker's Vlad III (Dracula), or Jack London's White Fang.</p 2>
	<p 3>This 2017 will mark my 9th year playing the piano and I am currently at Level 6 for Certificate of Merit.</p 3>

	<h2>Family</h2>
		<p 1>Dad: My dad’s family is originally from Wallachia, Romania. Jewish families took their names the city or the province where they lived. Wallech is a slight change from Wallachia because it is German and not Romanian. The name ‘Wallech’ is a spelling that is unique, and the only other person in the world who has the same name is my uncle. My grandfather, Henry Wallech, immigrated from Austria to the United States to escape Adolph Hitler in 1938. Hitler killed all the other members of his family, whom I do not know the name of.</p 1>
		<p 2>Mom: My mother came to the United States to study abroad, and is the first generation in this country.</p 2>
