<h2>Welcome to Magic the Gathering</h2> 
		 <p 1>
Magic the Gathering is an intense card game of tradegy, strategy and dexterity. With all kinds of variety of cards to choose from, you can make an unstoppable team on your side. Once you decide on which theme you would like to use, you begin to build the deck with different Mana, Creatures, Instants, Sorcery, and much more. You start the game with 20 lives and a complete 52 card deck and you must take down your opponent(s). The game can be a minimum of two people playing against each other for some fun, or the game can get really heated with up to twenty competitive people fighting for the biggest prize of the evening! But it’s all in the line of attack, experience, and expertise. 
The Battlefield
The battlefield is where all of the players’ cards are carefully placed out and played. Depending on how much space you’ve got and how much land you want to put down and build on, the game might have to get moved to a bigger table! Right in front of you should be the actual battlefield. On your dominant hand side should be your faced down Library, or the stack of cards where you choose a card at the beginning of each of your turns. The Graveyard is what it sounds like…a graveyard. This is the place where your destroyed creatures lay and also cards that are forced to lay to rest without even going out to the Battlefield!
The Library and Graveyard
On your dominant hand side should be your faced down Library, or the stack of cards where you choose a card at the beginning of each of your turns. The Graveyard is what it sounds like…a graveyard. This is the place where your destroyed creatures lay and also cards that are forced to lay to rest without even going out to the Battlefield!
Before We Start… Rules!
You first start by shuffing your personal deck, because we don’t want anyone cheating. So, you shuffle you deck any which way, and let your opponent(s) cut your deck. Cutting your deck is simply taking the top half of your deck and placing it on the bottom, or vice versa if you prefer it that way. 
After you’re done shuffling, you should always have seven cards in your hand no matter what. If you aren’t going to play a card during your turn, or if you don’t know if you want to play a card, you still draw a card from you r Library.
The Basic Card + Mana Card
The basic card consists of the name, how much Mana is costs to use, a picture relating to the Mana, Creatures, Instants, Sorcery etc, the name of what the card is (Basic Land, Creature, Instant, Sorcery etc) the occurrence, the description of the card’s power, and also the card’s damage ability to other players and  
In the top left heading, you see which Mana the card is and right underneath is a Mana related picture. Bottom of the picture describes what the card is, and also its occurrence. There is the symbol for the Mana, and the Mana’s colour in the background. And all of this is covered in the Mana’s color border. For instance, if you take the Mana ‘Forest’; the top left heading will say, ‘Forest’. Right underneath will have a forest or a singular tree. Below the picture, ‘Basic Land – Forest’ will appear on the left side of the margin, and the occurrence will appear. Under that, a simple tree design with a light green background is visible. And all of this bordered by a pleasant green. 
Or…
If you take a Gateway or Shrine, in the top left heading, you see the name of the Gateway or Shrine Land card. Usually, the picture is of a closed gateway with walls around it. Bottom of that picture, ‘Land – Plains Swamp’ will be written on the left side of the margin, and the Rare occurrence will appear. Underneath that, the Mana’s symbol, (in this case, the sun,) will appear the card’s ability once it enters the battle field. (As Godless Shrine enters the battlefield, you may pay two life. If you don’t, Godless Shrine enters the battlefield tapped), and also with soft gold and black merging in the middle is observable. And all of this has a White and Black border, merging in the middle of the card.
Tapping
Tapping is simply using a specific card. This may cost you to use Mana or other land cards. For instance, if I wanted to use a card that requires Mountain Mana, I would just place the card on the battlefield, and turn my Mana and the card I just placed on the battlefield to the right, or ‘tap’ the card.
Occurrence
Occurrence is a fancy word for how constant a card reappears in a new package you receive and in the world of Magic the Gathering. The chart goes as so…
-Black is Common
-Silver is Uncommon
-Gold is Rare
-Red is Ultra Rare
Friday Night Magic
Friday Night Magic is a Gathering of other players with the same interest in Magic the Gathering, who play each other. There is a five dollar entry free, but with that, you get a whole new booster pack with cards that you already have, cards that you don’t already have, and cards that you didn’t know even existed! While you play, you make new friends, exchange cards, learn new tricks, and just have a great time on a Friday night.
